# Scrabble

Our program should run a game of Scrabble on our device with which we can play Scrabble against our friends on different devices. Once some players join, the player who joined first can start the game. Every player has seven letter tiles. The game alternates between playersâ€™ turns. One each players turn, they can either: place tiles to make words and score points or select some number of tiles in their hand to redraw. When someone plays a word, other players can contest it if they think it is not a real word: if they are right, the player who played the fake word loses their turn, otherwise the contesting player loses their turn. When a player places tiles, they automatically redraw new ones. Once there are no tiles left or no player can play a tile, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.
